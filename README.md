## My first programming experience
####This Program was first created in 2014. At that time, my intention was to make a desktop program to be used by my father in his clinic. Using Visual Basic 2012 and Microsoft ACCESS (for the Database), I managed to make a relatively pleasing User Interface. This Desktop App Perform Basic CRUD Operations on Microsoft ACCESS patients  Database.  
##### The Interface use Arabic Language. The Program ask it's user to enter the patient's Name, Number, Phone Number, Date, Diagnosis and the sugested Treatment. The User can either Search for the paient info by using patient's Unique Number or using patient Cell Phone Number.
